    <h5 class="center">...from laying functions to package hatching!</h5>
    <h4>Maëlle Salmon</h4>

    <p>
      This hands-on workshop will allow you to transform a bunch of R functions 
      into an R package. You'll also learn how to make it usable and used! We'll 
      assume you can write functions, and a basic familiarity with 
      <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> & 
      <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Here is what we'll learn:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why develop a package?</li>
      <li>What is in a package?</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools">devtools</a> workflow to create a package</li>
      <li>Automatic tools for improving a package, from R CMD Check to linting</li>
      <li>Creating a slick documentation website with <a href="https://hadley.github.io/pkgdown/">pkgdown</a></li>
      <li>Why and how to have your package reviewed?</li>
      <li>How to make your package famous or at least reach your audience?</li>
      <li>Package analytics via CRAN logs and via the <a href="https://github.com/r-lib/gh">gh</a> package.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Attendees should bring a laptop with the latest versions of 
        <a href="https://www.r-project.org">R</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download">RStudio</a> 
        installed. Also bring your experience and questions about packages!

    <h3 class="center">The Sport Statistician’s Toolbox in R</h3>
    <h4>Stephanie Kovalchik</h4>

    <p>The workshop will cover a number of skills and statistical models that 
    are common in sports statistics and show how each can be implemented in R. 
    The workshop will introduce participants to a range of R packages and real 
    sports examples will be used throughout. It will be very hands-on!</p>
    
    <p>After completing this workshop, participants will be able to gather
    and clean public sports data more effectively, explore data with
    graphics, apply several common models used in sport, and share their sports 
    statistics ideas through a blog. A brief outline of the workshop is given 
    below.</p>

    <p>Workshop Outline:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sports data resources</li>
        <li>Web scraping</li>
        <li>Data exploration and validation</li>
        <li>Sports models and real applications
          <ul>
            <li>Bradley-Terry paired comparison models.<br>
            Application: Which team is the strongest in the English Football Association

            Application: How can we model the strike zone from baseball tracking 
            data?</li>
          </ul>
